# Django Simple API Project

This project demonstrates a simple REST API built with Django and Django REST Framework. It includes a basic model for messages and is designed to be containerized with Docker for easy deployment and scaling.

## Features

- REST API endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete messages.
- Containerization using Docker.
- Easy deployment setup with Amazon API Gateway.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Django 3+
- Django REST Framework
- Docker

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://yourrepositoryurl.git
   cd myproject
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Migrate the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

## Running the Application Locally

Run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the Django development server on `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Using the API

You can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL. Here are some example operations:

- **List Messages**
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/messages/
  ```

- **Create Message**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"Hello, World!"}' http://localhost:8000/api/messages/
  ```

- **Retrieve a Message**
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/messages/1/
  ```

- **Update a Message**
  ```bash
  curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"Hello, Django!"}' http://localhost:8000/api/messages/1/
  ```

- **Delete a Message**
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/messages/1/
  ```

## Dockerization

To build and run the application using Docker, execute:

```bash
docker build -t mydjangoapp .
docker run -p 8000:8000 mydjangoapp
```

## Deployment

Instructions for deploying this application with Amazon API Gateway will vary based on your specific setup and requirements. Ensure you have set up the necessary AWS services and configurations.
